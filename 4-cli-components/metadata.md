Getting started with Vue CLI and single-file components in Vue.js

## Role(s)

- student
- developer

## Level

- intermediate

## Product(s)

- Vue.js
- Azure Static Web Apps
- Visual Studio Code

## Prerequisites

- HTML/CSS
- Git
- npm
- JavaScript
- Vue.js

## Summary

While it is possible to create Vue.js applications using purely JavaScript, most developers need more power and flexibility. By using Vue CLI and single-file components you can use more robust tooling to enhance the development experience. We will see how to use Vue CLI to bootstrap an application, and how to create reusable components in Vue.

## Learning objectives

1. Using Vue CLI
1. Creating components

## Chunk your content into subtasks

Identify the subtasks of *module title*

| Subtask | What part of the introduction scenario does this subtask satisfy? | How will you assess it: **Exercise or Knowledge check**? | Which learning objective(s) does this help meet? | Does the subtask have enough learning content to justify an entire unit? If not, which other subtask will you combine it with? |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Creating a Vue application | Using Vue CLI | Exercise | Using Vue CLI | yes |
| Creating a component | Creating components | Exercise | Creating components | Making components reusable with props and custom events |
| Making components reusable with props and custom events | Creating Vue CLI | | Exercise | Creating components | Creating a component |

## Outline the units

1. **Introducing Vue CLI and custom components**

    We start by talking about what Vue CLI and components are.

1. **Getting started with Vue CLI**

    Let's talk about Vue CLI and its capabilities

    - Vue CLI
    - Installation
    - Use

1. **Exercise - Creating an application with Vue CLI**

    Let's create an application with Vue CLI

    - Installing Vue CLI
    - Running Vue CLI

    1. Installing Vue CLI
    1. Bootstrapping an application
    1. Exploring the code
    1. Running the development server

1. **Getting started with Vue components**

    Vue components allow you to create reusable building blocks.

    - Component concepts
    - Vue files
    - Importing components

1. **Exercise - Creating a component**

    Let's create our first component

    - Creating a component
    - Adding the code
    - Importing the component

    1. Install extensions
    1. Create the component
    1. Update the script
    1. Add the template
    1. Add style
    1. Use the host
    1. Test the application

1. **Component props**

    Props allow you to pass values into a component to make it more reusable

    - The reason for props
    - Adding props

1. **Exercise - Adding props to a component**

    Let's add props to a component

    - Adding and using props

    1. Create the component
    1. Add props and computed value
    1. Add the template display
    1. Add the component to the page
    1. Test the results

1. **Custom events for components**

    You can raise custom events from components

    - Why use custom events
    - Adding custom events

1. **Exercise - Adding a custom event to a component**

    Let's add a custom event

    - Working with custom events

    1. Creating the component
    1. Adding the code
    1. Adding the display template
    1. Add the component to the page
    1. Test the results

1. **Summary**

    We saw how to create custom components and use Vue CLI

1. **Knowledge check**
