In this module you learned to create components as separate Javascript files, then assemble those components within your Vue interface. You also learned how to communicate data properties from your main app down into your component. You accomplished this by creating props and generating a computed property within your app component.

## Coding Challenge

Now it's your turn! Armed with the information presented in this module, you should now be able to perform the following task on your own.

- Add a new component that encourages passengers to rate their experience from a previous space flight. In the next module you will learn how to add a rating form to this new component. For now the component can include just a heading and a line of text.
- Add a prop so you can use a data element from your main app within your new component. You can either use an existing data element from **main.js** or add a new data property.
