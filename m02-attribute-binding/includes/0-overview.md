In this module we demonstrate how Vue.js can be used to modify HTML attributes. An **attribute** allows us to modify the appearance or behavior of an HTML element type. Attributes consist of name/value pairs, and the values of an attribute are always contained within quotation marks. Examples would be the source for an HTML image tag (`<img src="./assets/images/space-4888643_1284x856.jpg">`) and any inline style specifications for that image (`style="width:12%;"`).

## Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this module you will:

- create an img element that is bound to an image property in the Vue data application
- use the v-bind directive to bind an attribute to an expression
- know how to use shorthand for directives
