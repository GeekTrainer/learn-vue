In this module we demonstrate how Vue.js can be used to modify HTML attributes. An attributes allows us to modify the appearance or behavior of an HTML element type. Attributes consist of name/value pairs, and the values of an attribute are always contained within quotation marks. Examples would be the source for an image tag (`<img src="./assets/images/space-4888643_1284x856.jpg">`) and any style specifications for that image (`style="width:12%;"`).
