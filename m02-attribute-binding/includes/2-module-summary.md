You have just learned how to dynamically bind an attribute to an expression. The attribute is the `src` for the image, and the expression is the information inside the quotes, i.e., the value of src, which is `selected_prod_img`. When the value of `selected_prod_img` is changed in the Vue app, the image will be immediately updated in our HTML interface.
