In summary, **Vue.js** is a powerful, lightweight framework based on JavaScript. It is simple to use, and allows you to create highly responsive front end applications. You can apply Vue.js incrementally without breaking your existing application. You can also scale up the complexity of your app by adding server-side functionality using the Vue CLI and additional builder tools.

In this module we introduced you to the Vue.js JavaScript framework. We demonstrated how to get started using a code editor, set up an HTML application page, and create a Vue.js code file that we linked in the HTML file. We created a starter application, displaying dynamic data in the page and through HTML attributes.
