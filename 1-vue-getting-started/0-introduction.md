**Vue.js** (or Vue) was created by Evan You and first released in February 2014. His objective in developing Vue was to create a progressive, lightweight version of JavaScript. It was designed to allow developers to create a user interface by adding a set of custom HTML attributes that connect software components with data. To accomplish this, Vue.js interprets the HTML attributes as **directives** that bind input or output parts of the page to a model that is represented by standard JavaScript variables. You can easily add the Vue core library to any page and immediately start creating dynamic HTML markup with powerful data binding and event handling features.

Upon completing this training module, you will understand the Vue.js framework and create a functional application.
