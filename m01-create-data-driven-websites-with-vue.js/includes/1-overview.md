Upon completion of this module you will:

- Understand why Vue.js was developed and how it can be implemented in two ways
- Preview a web product display page that you will develop in this course
- Select and install a code editor
- Create a simple Vue app and display it in a browser

**Vue.js** was created by Evan You and first released in February 2014. His objective in developing Vue was to create a progressive, lightweight version of JavaScript. It was designed to allow developers to create a user interface by adding a set of custom HTML attributes that connect software components with data. To accomplish this, Vue.js interprets the HTML attributes as **directives** that bind input or output parts of the page to a model that is represented by standard JavaScript variables. You can easily add the Vue core library to any page and immediately start creating dynamic HTML markup with powerful data binding and event handling features.

Vue is described as progressive because you can adopt it incrementally by adding functionality available in a library to power sophisticated single-page applications without needing to re-write your existing framework. Vue is also flexible enough to be configured with back end applications that rely on an external database or a Web server such as Node.

Vue.js is an open-source front end JavaScript framework loosely based on the **model-view-viewmodel** (MVVM) pattern. MVVM is a software design pattern that is structured to separate program logic and user interface controls. **Front end** refers to the user interface, which is generally a web browser or computer-based application. Values of the JavaScript variables can be manually set within the code on the front end or retrieved from static or dynamic resources such as JSON data files. **Back end** refers to an external server that generally contains an external database and server application that retrieves and processes information, which is then returned to the front end for display to the user.

We will address the more complicated **back end** concepts and the Vue CLI in later modules within this course. First, let's focus on functionality available through the core library for simple front end development that does not require server processing.
