## Module Summary

In summary, Vue.js is a powerful, lightweight framework based on JavaScript. It is simple to use, and allows you to create highly responsive front end applications. You can apply Vue.js incrementally without breaking your existing application. You can also scale up the complexity of your app by adding server-side functionality using the Vue CLI and additional builder tools.

In this module we introduced you to the Vue.js JavaScript framework. We demonstrated how to get started using a code editor, set up an HTML application page, and create a Vue.js code file that we linked in the HTML page. We created a simple starter application and explained how to preview your Vue app in a browser or render it in a live server using an extension installed in the VS Code editor.
