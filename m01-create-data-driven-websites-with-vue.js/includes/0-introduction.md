Vue is a progressive, lightweight JavaScript framework that allows developers to build user interfaces such as webpages. It is quite versatile because you can adopt it incrementally by adding functionality available in a library to power sophisticated single-page applications with client-side processing that does not rely on a database server. You can later scale it up to a server-side framework that runs on a Web server such as Node. After completing this training module, you will understand the Vue.js framework and create a functional application.
