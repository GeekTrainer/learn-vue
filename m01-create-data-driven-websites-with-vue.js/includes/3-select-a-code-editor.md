To follow along with the exercises and coding examples described in this learning path, you will want to use a code editor. While a simple text editor such as **Notepad** on a Windows machine or **TextEdit** on a Mac would work, you may want to use an editor that provides functionality such as code-hinting and syntax highlighting. You are of course free to use whatever editor you prefer.

We will demonstrate this project using **VS Code**. You can download and set up a free version of VS Code for the Windows, Mac or Linux platform from the [Visual Studio Code download site](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

After completing the VS Code installation, you will also want to install the following extensions:

- [Vue (syntax highlighting for Vue.js](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jcbuisson.vue) - jcbuisson
- [Vue VSCode Snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.vue-vscode-snippets) - sarah.drasner
- [Vetur - Vue tooling for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=octref.vetur) - jcbuisson
- [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) - Ritwick Dey
- [es6-string-html](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Tobermory.es6-string-html) - Tobermory
