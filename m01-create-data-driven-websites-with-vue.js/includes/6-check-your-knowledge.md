Select the correct statement from options listed below.

()Vue applications must make an external call to a back end server that hosts a database application.{{Incorrect.

()In order to create a Vue application, you will need to re-write your existing framework.{{Incorrect. Vue is described as a progressive application, which means it can be added to any existing framework and implemented in a progressive manner. This means you can start with simple functionality and continue to build a more complex application, as needed.}}
(x)A Vue application can be implemented by entering a simple script tag in an HTML document that references the Vue core library.{{Correct! There is no need to use external tools or an external server to build a powerful single-page application in an HTML web browser. The Vue application details can be scripted within the HTML page, or the page can be linked to a separate JavaScript file that contains the Vue application code.}}
