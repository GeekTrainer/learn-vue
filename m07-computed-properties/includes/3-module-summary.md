In this module you learned how to create computed properties so you can display multiple data properties combined with additional text strings. This allowed you to display a simple property in your Vue interface.

You also added several text elements to create special content for selected features, rather than displaying the same basic cruise information for all selected product items.

## Coding Challenge

Now it's your turn! Armed with the information presented in this module, you should be able to perform the following task on your own.

- Add an onSale boolean to the data
- Use a computed property to display a string of text whenever onSale is true
  - Include a text string plus at least 1 data property when creating your computed property
