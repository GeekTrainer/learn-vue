## Summary

Creating dynamic web applications typically allows users to interact with the page and data. In this module we will see how to add forms to a Vue.js page, and respond to user events. We will also see how we can add computed values to calculate values based on updates to the data.

## Learning objectives

1. Working with forms
1. Adding events
1. Computed properties

## Chunk your content into subtasks

Identify the subtasks of *module title*

| Subtask | What part of the introduction scenario does this subtask satisfy? | How will you assess it: **Exercise or Knowledge check**? | Which learning objective(s) does this help meet? | Does the subtask have enough learning content to justify an entire unit? If not, which other subtask will you combine it with? |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Adding a form to a page | Working with forms | Exercise | Working with forms | Adding a form to a page |
| Binding data to a form | Working with forms | Exercise | Working with forms | Adding a form to a page |
| Responding to user events | Adding events | Exercise | Adding events | Yes |
| Calculating values dynamically | Computed properties | Exercise | Computed properties | Yes |

## Outline the units

1. **Overview of dynamic data and events**

    Let's see how we can incorporate interactivity into a Vue.js application.

1. **Working with forms**

    Let's explore how to bind Vue.js data to a form.

    - v-model directive
    - Binding to various controls

1. **Exercise - Binding data to forms**

    Let's add a form to a page and bind data

    - Adding a form
    - Binding data

    1. Clone the starter
    1. Create the form
    1. Walk through the code
    1. Test the results

1. **Working with events**

    Events are raised when the user interacts with the page. Let's see how we can respond to events.

    - Event concepts
    - Binding to events

1. **Exercise - Adding event handlers**

    Let's add events to a page

    - Adding the code
    - Adding the control

    1. Add the function
    1. Add the button
    1. Test the page

1. **Understanding computed properties**

    Computed properties allow you to add new values based on existing data

    - Explaining computed properties
    - Adding computed properties

1. **Exercise - Adding computed properties**

    Let's add a computed property

    - computed properties

    1. Add the computed property
    1. Add the display to the page
    1. Test the page

1. **Summary**

    We saw how to allow the user to interact with the page.

1. **Knowledge check**

    What types of questions will test *learning objective*? *[(Knowledge check guidance)](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/learn-docs/docs/id-guidance-knowledge-check)*

    - Multiple choice
