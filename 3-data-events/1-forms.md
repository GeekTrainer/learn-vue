The data returned by the `data()` function in a Vue app, or component, is generically referred to as *state*. State is any information your application needs to track to perform the necessary operations. Users typically modify state through HTML forms. Vue.js allows you to bind data to a form, allowing users to update state.

## v-model

The `v-model` directive creates a *two-way* binding between an HTML control and the associated data. This means whenever the value is updated in the form, it's updated inside your application's state. `v-model` supports binding to any form control, including checkboxes, textboxes and dropdown lists.

> ![NOTE]
> `v-bind` creates a one-way binding, meaning any changes the user might make in the form would not be stored in state.

For all examples below, you will use the following Vue application:

```javascript
Vue.createApp({
    data() {
        return {
            name: 'Cheryl',
            status: -1,
            active: true,
            benefitsSelected: 'yes',
            statusList: [
                'full-time',
                'part-time',
                'contractor'
            ]
        }
    }
})
```

## Binding to textboxes

To bind to a textbox, you use the `v-model` directive.

```html
<input type="text" v-model="name" />
```

The `name` property will be updated whenever the textbox value changes. If you wish to use a `textarea` instead, the syntax is the same; you use `v-model="name"` just as before.

## Binding to checkboxes

Typically, Boolean values are bound to checkboxes, as they allow for the option to be toggled. To bind the `active` option we can use `v-model` as we've done before:

```html
<input type="checkbox" v-model="active" /> Is active
```

### Handling non boolean cases

However, there may be times when the toggle isn't a Boolean value, but maybe two choices such as *yes*/*no*. In this case, you can use `true-value` and `false-value` to indicate the associated value for the checkbox being checked (true) or unchecked (false).

```html
<input type="checkbox" v-bind="benefitsSelected" true-value="yes" false-value="no"> Benefits selected: {{ benefitsSelected }}
```

## Dropdown lists

Dropdown lists are created in HTML by using `select` to create the list, and `option` to add options. The `select` tag stores the selected value of the dropdown list, so you will use it to bind to your model.

In Vue, there are three things you need to do:

- **Create a list of options**. To create the list of `option` elements, you use `v-for` to loop through and create an option element for each item in the array.
- **Identify value**. For each option you create, you need to identify what the value is. If your list is just an array of say strings, it's recommended that you either store the string itself or the selected index as value, like the below:

   ```html
   <select v-model="selectedIndex">
     <option v-for="(stringItem, index) in arrayOfStrings" :value="index"> 
     {{}}
     </option>
   </select>
   ```

   If your list stores an array of objects, you need to point out what the display property is and where the value is, like so:

   ```html
   <select v-model="selectedValue">
     <option v-for="item in items" :value="item.value">
     {{ item.displayProperty }}
     </option>
   </select>  
   ```

- **Keep track of the selected value**. You can bind the selected value to the select tag by using `v-model`. Here you can choose between keeping track of the index or the value of the item, it's up to you.

### Creating the dropdown

You create the list of options by using `v-for`, which loops through a list of items. You elect to set the value to be the index of the item in the array. You use `v-for(status, index) in statusList`, which will provide the index for each item. You then set the `:value` of each option to the `index`, and display `status` as the option for the user.

```html
<select v-model="statusIndex">
    <!-- Create a message to select one -->
    <option disabled value="">Please select one</option>
    <!-- Use v-for to create the list of options -->
    <option v-for="(status, index) in statusList" :value="index">
        {{ status }}
    </option>
</select>
```

Finally, by adding `v-model="statusIndex"`, you ensure that, when a user selects an item, the value of the `statusIndex` data property, will be updated to the selected index.
