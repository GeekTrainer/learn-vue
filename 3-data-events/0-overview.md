In this lesson we demonstrate how to work with data in Vue. We'll cover capture event handlers (such as clicking a button or hovering their mouse over an object on a webpage), working with properties and using a special Vue affordance called v-bind to build dynamic forms.

## Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this module you will:

- Use an expression to calculate a value
- Set up a listener for an event
- Trigger application logic when the event occurs by:
  - Changing inline data properties for implementing simple logic
  - Creating a method that can be used to implement more complex logic

If you completed the prior exercises, your HTML file should look like the image below when viewed in a browser. You can continue to build upon your own files, or you can use the the files in our [starting code](link).
