In this module you learned how to define a data array with multiple values for a single property in your Vue application. You then displayed those elements in the browser using either an unordered list or an ordered list.

## Coding Challenge

Now it's your turn! Armed with the information presented in this module, you should now be able to perform the following tasks on your own.

- Add an array to the data object to list group discount rates (sample categories below):
  - $1,000 (each person) - groups of 3-4
  - $1,250 (each person) - groups of 5-6
  - $1,750 (each person) - groups of 7-10
  - $2,500 (each person) - groups of 11 or more
- Display the data array in an unordered list.
- Add an `<h4>` tag to display the heading **Group Discounts" above the list of discount rates.
