## Unit: Add styles and bindings

- add a style to create a colored circle (to indicate product color)

- v-bind

- remember that the style object is Javascript, so either:

- do not use a dash within an object name because JS would interpret it as a minus (subtraction) symbol, OR

- put CSS property name within single quote (style itself is using double quotes), OR

- for complex styles you can bind to an object that lives within your data

## Unit: Change behavior of objects with class bindings

- change behavior of button (to disable it when InStock is false)

- use class binding to make the button "look disabled" when it is disabled

- binding multiple classes using inline ternary operators

- CHECK OUT Vue docs for more examples (include link)
