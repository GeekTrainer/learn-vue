In this lesson we demonstrate how to use the `v-bind` directive to manipulate class and style bindings.

## Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this module you will:

- Apply a style/class to an object using `v-bind`
- Change the behavior of a button to disable it for a specified condition
- Change the style of the button to make it "appear" disabled when it is disabled
