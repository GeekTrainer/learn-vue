In this module you learned how Vue lets you control class and style attributes and behaviors of objects in your HTML interface. You accomplished this by binding classes and styles to your elements based on your application data properties and methods.

## Coding Challenge

Now it's your turn! Armed with the information presented in this module, you should now be able to perform the following task on your own.

- Set changes to the booking button:
  - Text to read "Book a Cruise" when the 1st thumbnail is highlighted
  - Text to read "Add Feature" when any of the other thumbnails are highlighted
  - Bind the style of the "Feature" buttons to a different color than the "Book a Cruise" button so users will notice the difference in button text
