Once you have become familiar with the Vue.js basics, you might want to learn how to use the Vue CLI (Command Line Interface) to create projects. The CLI provides a complete system for rapid Vue.js project development. Vue also has a UI (User Interface) that can be helpful for developers because it handles a lot of details like managing dependencies. The VSCode editor can also be used with extensions that provide handy development tools like syntax highlighting and code completion.

In this module, we'll look at how to use the CLI to create a project and we'll focus on a new type of Vue programming model called a *Single Page Application*. Single Page Applications (SPA) are just a different way--a modularized way--to structure a Vue project using single-file components. You can use all the information you already learned about Vue in SPAs. However the file structure and type of files you'll use are different. Instead of having to instantiate Vue in a JavaScript file and put your template and style information in other files, you can include everything you need for your Vue in a single file. And this gives you a single page application!

## Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this module you will:

- Understand how to use the Vue CLI (Command Line Interface) to create and manage Vue projects
- Learn about Single Page Applications and why and where you would use them.
