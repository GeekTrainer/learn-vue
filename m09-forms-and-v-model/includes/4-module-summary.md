## Coding Challenge

Now it's your turn! Armed with the information presented in this module, you should now be able to perform the following task on your own.

- Add a new form to the "Welback Back to the Galaxy! component that allows users to rate a previous Galaxy Tour.
  - If an element in your form should have a numeric entry, add `.number` following `v-model` (e.g., `v-model.number="rating"`). This will cast the value of those data entries as `numbers`.
- Use `v-bind` to create two-way binding of data from the form to the Vue template.
- Add form validation.
- Output the data submitted on the form to your HTML interface.
