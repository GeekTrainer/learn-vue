Before users decide to book a cruise, they will want to know what is available and how much it costs. Let's display the cabins available to the users.

## Clone the starter repository and explore the code

You've been provided a starter repository for this module.

1. Clone the starter repository and open the folder in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) by executing the following code

    ```bash
    git clone [INSERT REPOSITORY LINK]
    cd [INSERT FOLDER NAME]
    code .
    ```

1. Open **index.js**. Note the array of `productClasses`. Each `productClass` has `name`, `price`, `seatsAvailable`, and `earlyBird` properties.

## Display the list of products and prices

Let's update the HTML to display the list of all products and their prices.

1. Open **index.html**.
1. Below the line which reads `TODO: Add code to display classes`, add the following HTML:

    ```html
    <div v-for="(productClass, index) in productClasses" :key="index" class="row">
        <div class="column">
            {{ productClass.name }}
        </div>
        <div class="column">
            $ {{ productClass.price.toLocaleString('en-US') }}
        </div>
        <!-- More to come -->

    </div>
    ```

### Exploring the code

Note the `v-for` directive. This will create a new `div` element for each `productClass` item. You also generate the `index` for each item, which you use as the `:key` for the display. Finally, you see the appropriate code to display the `name` and `price`, for each `productClass` item.

> ![NOTE]
> Note the call to `toLocalString`. Because you're working inside the `{{ }}` you're able to call any valid JavaScript. Also, while the locale string is set to **en-US**, you can update it to your particular region.

## Launch the page in Live Server

The [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension for Visual Studio Code creates a development web server which will automatically refresh the page as changes are detected. After installing the extension (by clicking on the link if you haven't already), we can use it to host our page.

1. Save all files
1. Open the command palate in Visual Studio Code by hitting **Ctl-Shift-P** (or **Cmd-Shift-P** on a Mac)
1. Type **Live Server: Open with Live Server**

    A dialog will open in the bottom right saying your page is now being hosted on [http://localhost:5500](http://localhost:5500).

1. Open a browser and navigate to [http://localhost:5500](http://localhost:5500)

You should now see the page you created!
