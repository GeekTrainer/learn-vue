## Summary

One of the goals of any web framework is to update the display based on data values. We will explore how you can make your page dynamic based on the values, and display lists of information.

## Learning objectives

1. Displaying lists
1. Conditional rendering

## Chunk your content into subtasks

Identify the subtasks of *module title*

| Subtask | What part of the introduction scenario does this subtask satisfy? | How will you assess it: **Exercise or Knowledge check**? | Which learning objective(s) does this help meet? | Does the subtask have enough learning content to justify an entire unit? If not, which other subtask will you combine it with? |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Displaying lists of data | Displaying lists | Exercise | Displaying lists | Yes |
| Showing or hiding information | Conditional rendering | Exercise | Conditional rendering | Yes |

## Outline the units

1. **Overview of dynamic displays**

    When working with data you need the ability to change the display. We will explore some of the core concepts to make this happen.

1. **Rendering lists**

    Let's see how we can use a directive to loop through an array of information

    - v-for syntax
    - working with keys

1. **Exercise - Rendering lists**

    Let's display a list of information

    - Displaying list data

    1. Clone the starter
    1. Display the list
    1. Exploring the code
    1. Test the page

1. **Conditional rendering**

    There are times when you don't want to show certain information based on the data. We will see how we can control if and when to display values.

    - v-if/v-else
    - v-show

1. **Exercise - Conditional rendering**

    Let's implement conditional rendering

    - v-if/v-else
    - v-show

    1. Add the code
    1. Test the display

1. **Summary**

    We saw how to control the display with data in Vue.js

1. **Knowledge check**

    What types of questions will test *learning objective*? *[(Knowledge check guidance)](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/learn-docs/docs/id-guidance-knowledge-check)*
